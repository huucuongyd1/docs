## Creating A Connection

This creates a connection so that you can interact with the server.

```cs C#
using System;
using Amazon;
using Amazon.S3;
using Amazon.S3.Model;

string accessKey = "put your access key here!";
string secretKey = "put your secret key here!";

AmazonS3Config config = new AmazonS3Config();
config.ServiceURL = "objects.dreamhost.com";

AmazonS3Client s3Client = new AmazonS3Client(
        accessKey,
        secretKey,
        config
        );
```

## Listing Owned Buckets 

This gets a list of Buckets that you own. This also prints out the bucket name and creation date of each bucket.

```cs C#
ListBucketsResponse response = client.ListBuckets();
foreach (S3Bucket b in response.Buckets)
{
        Console.WriteLine("{0}\t{1}", b.BucketName, b.CreationDate);
}
```

The output will look something like this:

``` Console
mahbuckat1   2011-04-21T18:05:39.000Z
mahbuckat2   2011-04-21T18:05:48.000Z
mahbuckat3   2011-04-21T18:07:18.000Z
```

## Create A Bucket

This creates a new bucket called `my-new-bucket`.

```cs C#
PutBucketRequest request = new PutBucketRequest();
request.BucketName = "my-new-bucket";
client.PutBucket(request);
```

## Listing A Bucket's Content

This gets a list of objects in the bucket. This also prints out each object’s name, the file size, and last modified date.

```cs C#
ListObjectsRequest request = new ListObjectsRequest();
request.BucketName = "my-new-bucket";
ListObjectsResponse response = client.ListObjects(request);
foreach (S3Object o in response.S3Objects)
{
        Console.WriteLine("{0}\t{1}\t{2}", o.Key, o.Size, o.LastModified);
}
```

The output will look something like this:

``` Console
myphoto1.jpg 251262  2011-08-08T21:35:48.000Z
myphoto2.jpg 262518  2011-08-08T21:38:01.000Z
```

## Delete A Bucket

<Note>
The Bucket must be empty! Otherwise it won’t work!
</Note>

```cs C#
DeleteBucketRequest request = new DeleteBucketRequest();
request.BucketName = "my-new-bucket";
client.DeleteBucket(request);
```

## Creating An Object 

This creates a file `hello.txt` with the string `"Hello World!"`.

```cs C#
PutObjectRequest request = new PutObjectRequest();
request.BucketName  = "my-new-bucket";
request.Key         = "hello.txt";
request.ContentType = "text/plain";
request.ContentBody = "Hello World!";
client.PutObject(request);
```

## Change An Object's ACL

This makes the object `hello.txt` to be publicly readable, and `secret_plans.txt` to be private.

```cs C#
PutACLRequest request = new PutACLRequest();
request.BucketName = "my-new-bucket";
request.Key        = "hello.txt";
request.CannedACL  = S3CannedACL.PublicRead;
client.PutACL(request);

PutACLRequest request2 = new PutACLRequest();
request2.BucketName = "my-new-bucket";
request2.Key        = "secret_plans.txt";
request2.CannedACL  = S3CannedACL.Private;
client.PutACL(request2);
```

## Download An Object (To A File)

This downloads the object `perl_poetry.pdf` and saves it in `C:\Users\larry\Documents`

```cs C#
GetObjectRequest request = new GetObjectRequest();
request.BucketName = "my-new-bucket";
request.Key        = "perl_poetry.pdf";
GetObjectResponse response = client.GetObject(request);
response.WriteResponseStreamToFile("C:\\Users\\larry\\Documents\\perl_poetry.pdf");
```

## Delete An Object

This deletes the object `goodbye.txt`.

```cs C#
DeleteObjectRequest request = new DeleteObjectRequest();
request.BucketName = "my-new-bucket";
request.Key        = "goodbye.txt";
client.DeleteObject(request);
```

## Generate Object Download URLS (Signed And Unsigned)

This generates an unsigned download URL for `hello.txt`. This works because we made `hello.txt` public by setting the ACL above. This then generates a signed download URL for `secret_plans.txt` that will work for 1 hour. Signed download URLs will work for the time period even if the object is private (when the time period is up, the URL will stop working).

<Note>
The C# S3 Library does not have a method for generating unsigned URLs, so the following example only shows generating signed URLs.
</Note>

```cs C#
GetPreSignedUrlRequest request = new GetPreSignedUrlRequest();
request.BucketName = "my-bucket-name";
request.Key        = "secret_plans.txt";
request.Expires    = DateTime.Now.AddHours(1);
request.Protocol   = Protocol.HTTP;
string url = client.GetPreSignedURL(request);
Console.WriteLine(url);
```

The output of this will look something like:

```
http://objects.dreamhost.com/my-bucket-name/secret_plans.txt?Signature=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&Expires=1316027075&AWSAccessKeyId=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
