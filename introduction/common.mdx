## Bucket and Hostname

There are two different modes of accessing the buckets. The first (preferred) method identifies the bucket as the top-level directory in the URI.

```
GET /mybucket HTTP/1.1
Host: hn.storage.weodata.vn
```

The second method identifies the bucket via a virtual bucket host name. For example:

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: mybucket.hn.storage.weodata.vn
```

To configure virtual hosted buckets, you can either set `weo_dns_name = hn.storage.weodata.vn` in weodata.conf, or add `hn.storage.weodata.vn` to the list of `hostnames` in your zonegroup configuration. 

<Tip>
We prefer the first method, because the second method requires expensive domain certification and DNS wild cards.

<Tip>
You can define multiple hostname directly with the `weo_dns_name` parameter.
